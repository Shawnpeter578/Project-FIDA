# Auth Separation

## Changes
- **Frontend (`dist/index.html`):**
    - Removed `authScreen` UI block (Login/Signup forms).
    - Removed Google Sign-In script.
    - Added `<script>` at the top of `<head>` to strictly redirect to `login.html` if `fida_token` is missing.
    - Updated `checkAuth` logic to redirect on failure instead of showing an inline modal.
    - Updated `logout` logic to redirect to `login.html`.
- **Frontend (`dist/login.html`):**
    - Standardized `localStorage` key to `fida_token` (was `token`).
    - This ensures `index.html` sees the token set by `login.html`.
- **Frontend (`dist/script.js`):**
    - (No changes needed, as logic was mostly in `index.html` inline script).
