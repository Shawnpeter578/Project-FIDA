### Modified
- `dist/login.html`: Removed "Artist" login option from the frontend.
    - Updated CSS for `.role-highlighter` width (33.33% -> 50%).
    - Removed HTML button for Artist.
    - Updated JavaScript `setRole`, `handleSignup`, `handleLogin`, and `redirectUser` to remove artist logic.

### Description
Removed the artist login/signup option from the login page UI as requested. This change is frontend-only; backend logic for artist roles (if any) remains untouched but is no longer accessible via the standard login flow.
