## Phase 2 & 3: Frontend Optimization & Ultra UI Integration

### Architecture & Modularization
- **Logic Extraction:** Moved over 1000 lines of inline JavaScript from `index.html` to `dist/script.js`.
- **Global State Management:** Centralized state for `currentUser`, `currentEvents`, and `joinedEventIds` to ensure UI consistency across views.
- **Improved Initialization:** Refactored auth checks and splash screen logic for smoother application startup.

### UI/UX Upgrades ("Ultra UI")
- **Platinum & Crimson Theme:** Applied consistent light-mode aesthetic with glassmorphism and crimson accents.
- **Sticky Search Bar:** Implemented a modern, high-performance search bar that remains accessible at the top of the feed.
- **Pro Dashboard:** Upgraded the host view with guest counts and quick access to scanning.
- **Onboarding Redesign:** Visual overhaul of the welcome flow using high-quality imagery and refined typography.

### Functional Enhancements
- **Manual Entry System:** Added a 6-digit Numpad interface for checking in guests who cannot use QR codes.
- **Atomic Rendering:** Refactored `renderFeed` to handle large datasets more efficiently.
- **Transition Manager:** Standardized modal and view switching logic with spring-based animations.

### Logic Preservation
- Re-integrated **Razorpay** payment flow into the new UI components.
- Verified that all `FidaAPI` calls map correctly to existing backend endpoints.
