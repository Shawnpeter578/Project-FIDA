### Fixed
- `tests/app.test.js`: 
    - Updated `mockCollection.updateOne` to support `$each` operator within `$push`. This ensures multi-ticket purchase tests can correctly persist tickets in the mock database.
    - Updated `mockCollection.updateOne` to support positional operator `$` within `$set`. This ensures ticket check-in tests can correctly update the status of a specific ticket in the mock database.
    - Added a mock for `../src/utils/email` to prevent timeouts caused by actual email sending attempts during integration tests.

### Description
Addressed test failures reported in `testfails.md` by enhancing the mock database implementation in the integration test suite. The mocks now correctly simulate advanced MongoDB operators used in the multi-ticket purchase and check-in flows.
