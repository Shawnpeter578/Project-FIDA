# Change Log: Restore Missing Frontend Logic

## Description
Restored critical utility functions in `dist/script.js` that were missing, causing navigation, search, and profile features to fail.

## Changes
- **File:** `dist/script.js`
- **Restored Functions:**
    -   `switchView(viewName, btnEl)`: Enables Dock navigation.
    -   `handleSearch(val)`: Enables feed filtering.
    -   `saveProfile(e)`: Enables profile updates via `PUT /api/auth/me`.
    -   `showToast(msg)`: Provides feedback notifications.
    -   `formatDate(dStr)`: Formats dates for event cards.
    -   `closeCreateModal()`, `openFilterModal()`: UI interactions.

## Rationale
These functions are referenced in the HTML (`onclick` handlers) and within `script.js` itself but were not defined in the file, likely due to a previous refactoring error. Restoring them ensures the "Ultra UI" functions as intended.

## Verification
-   **Manual Test:**
    -   Click Dock buttons -> Views should switch.
    -   Type in Search -> Feed should filter.
    -   Save Profile -> Toast should appear and data should persist.
