## Authentication Update
*   **File:** `src/auth_path.js`
*   **Changes:**
    *   Updated `POST /google` to accept an optional `role` parameter.
    *   Logic:
        *   Validates the role against `['user', 'artist', 'organizer']`.
        *   Sets the `role` field in the user document *only on initial creation* (`$setOnInsert`).
        *   Includes the user's role in the response and the signed JWT token.
