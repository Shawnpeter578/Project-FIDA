## Changes

    - Implemented `POST /api/events` for event creation with `FormData`.
    - Added real-time dashboard statistics (Revenue, Tickets Sold).
    - Connected `html5-qrcode` to `POST /api/events/checkin` for verifying attendees.
- **Frontend UI (`dist/organizer.html`):**
    - Removed legacy inline scripts.
    - Imported `organizer.app.js` to power the dashboard.
- **Documentation (`prompt.md`):**
    - Updated with the executed proposal for the dashboard integration.
