## Change Log - 2026-02-07 10:45

### Added
- `tests/email.test.js`: New test suite for email functionality.
    - Includes unit test for `sendTicketEmail` mocking `nodemailer` and `qrcode`.
    - Includes basic scaffolding for integration testing (mocks for DB and Auth).

### Description
Added a dedicated test file to verify the email sending logic. The test mocks external dependencies (Nodemailer, QRCode) to ensure the `sendTicketEmail` utility functions correctly without sending actual emails.
