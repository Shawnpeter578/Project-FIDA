### Modified
- `dist/script.js`: Updated `createOrder` to accept a `quantity` parameter.
- `dist/index.html`:
    - Added state variables `currentQuantity` and `currentEventPrice`.
    - Added `updateQuantity()` helper function.
    - Updated `openDetail()` to render a Quantity Selector for unjoined, available events.
    - Updated `joinClub()` to pass `currentQuantity` to `createOrder` and `verifyPayment`.
    - Updated `showUserQR()` to display multiple QR codes for multi-ticket holders.
    - Updated `onScanSuccess()` to parse and send `ticketId` instead of `userId` for check-ins.

### Description
Implemented the frontend logic for the Multi-Ticket Purchase System. Users can now select up to 10 tickets when joining an event. The "My Passes" view now aggregates all tickets for an event and displays individual QR codes for each ticket. The scanner logic was updated to validate based on unique Ticket IDs.
