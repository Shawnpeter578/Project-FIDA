# Change Log: Fix API Base URL for Local Access

## Description
Updated `FidaAPI.BASE_URL` in `dist/script.js` to use a relative path (`/api`) instead of hardcoded `http://localhost:3000/api` for non-production environments.

## Rationale
Users accessing the application via `127.0.0.1` or a local network IP were encountering a "Login Loop" (successful login followed by immediate logout). This was caused by `dist/script.js` attempting to fetch from `localhost:3000`, creating a Cross-Origin request that failed (or was blocked by browser security policies), leading `checkAuth` to assume the session was invalid and trigger a logout. Using a relative path ensures the API request matches the document origin.

## Changes
- **File:** `dist/script.js`
- **Change:** `http://localhost:3000/api` -> `/api`

## Verification
-   **Manual Test:** Access app via `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Login. Should persist session.
