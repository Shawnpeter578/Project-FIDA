# Role-based UI Visibility

## Changes
- **Backend (`src/auth_path.js`):**
    - Updated `GET /api/auth/me` to include the `role` field in the response projection.
- **Frontend (`dist/index.html`):**
    - Assigned ID `createBtn` to the "Create" FAB and `hostTab` to the "Host" dashboard dock item.
    - Set both to `display: none` by default.
    - Updated `updateUserUI()` to show these elements only if the authenticated user's role is `organizer`.
