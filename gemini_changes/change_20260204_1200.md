# Change Log: Implement QR Check-in Logic

## Date: 2026-02-04
## Author: Gemini

### Description
Implemented the backend logic required for the QR code check-in system described in the integration plan (Prompt #5).

### Changes
*   **Modified `src/event_path.js`:**
    *   **Updated `POST /join`:** Refactored to store attendees as objects `{ userId, name, status, joinedAt }` instead of simple strings. This allows tracking individual attendee status.
    *   **Added `POST /checkin`:** New endpoint to handle QR code scans.
        *   Accepts `{ eventId, userName }`.
        *   Validates that the requestor is either an 'organizer' or the creator of the event.
        *   Finds the attendee by name and updates their status to 'checked-in'.

### Impact
*   Enables the frontend Organizer Dashboard to successfully check in users.
*   **Note:** Existing events with string-based attendee lists will need migration or manual clearing to support this new feature fully. New joins will work immediately.
