## Phase 1: Backend Hardening

### Security Enhancements
- **Integrated Helmet:** Added `helmet` middleware to `src/app.js` to set secure HTTP headers and protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Implemented Rate Limiting:** Added `express-rate-limit` to all `/api` routes in `src/app.js` (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP) to prevent DoS and brute-force attacks.
- **Strict Auth Verification:** Updated `authenticateJWT` in `src/auth/middleware.js` to perform a database lookup. Tokens are now rejected if the associated user has been deleted from the database.

### Structural Integrity
- Standardized error messages in `app.js` for rate limiting.
- Ensured `trust proxy` is set to `1` for accurate IP-based rate limiting in production environments (e.g., Koyeb).

### Verification
- Verified middleware injection order in `src/app.js`.
- Confirmed database singleton availability for auth middleware.
