# Change Log: Organizer Dashboard Enhancements

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Time:** 12:30
**Agent:** Gemini

## Description
Updated the Organizer Console (`organizer.html` and `organizer.app.js`) to include event descriptions and aggregated ticket sales notifications.

## Changes

### `dist/organizer.html`
*   Added a `<textarea>` field for "Description" in the Create Event modal form (`#cDesc`).

### `dist/organizer.app.js`
*   **Method `handleCreate`:** Updated to capture the value from `#cDesc` and append it to the `formData` sent to the backend.
*   **Method `renderDashboard`:** Implemented logic to aggregate ticket sales.
    *   Iterates through all attendees of events.
    *   Groups attendees by `paymentId` (or `ticketId` for free events) to identify single transactions.
    *   Generates activity feed items in the format: "User bought X tickets for Event Y".
    *   Replaced the previous mock activity feed logic.

## Verification
*   Verified that the description field appears in the UI.
*   Verified that the backend `POST /events` endpoint (in `src/event_path.js`) already supports `description` field.
*   The dashboard logic now correctly interprets the flat `attendees` array from the database and visualizes multi-ticket purchases as single activities.
