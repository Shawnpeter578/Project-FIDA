## Description
Fixed an issue where Google Sign-In would hang on a white screen due to security headers.

## Changes
- Modified `src/app.js`: Updated `helmet` configuration to include `crossOriginOpenerPolicy: { policy: "same-origin-allow-popups" }`.

## Impact
This change allows the Google Sign-In popup to communicate back to the main application window, resolving the "white screen" hang issue during the authentication flow.
