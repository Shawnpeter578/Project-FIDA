## Backend Update: Event Management
*   **File:** `src/event_path.js`
*   **Changes:**
    *   Implemented `POST /api/events/checkin`: Allows organizers to check in guests.
    *   Logic:
        *   Verifies organizer role.
        *   Resolves user by name (from QR payload) to UserID.
        *   Checks if user is in the `attendees` list.
        *   Adds user to `checkedIn` list if not already present.
