## Razorpay Integration for Paid Events

### Changes
1.  **Backend (`src/event_path.js`):**
    *   Integrated `razorpay` SDK.
    *   Added `POST /create-order` to initiate Razorpay transactions.
    *   Added `POST /verify-payment` to verify Razorpay signatures and handle event registration after successful payment.
    *   Updated `POST /join` to reject free registrations for paid events (Price > 0).
    *   Added `price` as a required field for event creation.

2.  **Configuration (`src/config/config.js`):**
    *   (Already contained `razor_key` and `razor_secret_key` placeholders).

3.  **Frontend (`dist/script.js`):**
    *   Updated `FidaAPI.events` with `createOrder` and `verifyPayment` methods.

4.  **Frontend UI (`dist/index.html`):**
    *   Included Razorpay Checkout script.
    *   Refactored `joinClub(id)` to implement the Razorpay Checkout flow (Order -> Payment -> Verification).
    *   Updated event creation form to require a minimum price of 1 INR.
    *   Updated UI to display currency as ₹ (INR) instead of $.

### Verification Status
*   Backend routes implemented and signature verification logic added using `crypto`.
*   Frontend flow integrated with Razorpay's `handler` callback.
*   Manual testing required with valid Razorpay credentials.
