## Test Suite Updates
*   **File:** `tests/app.test.js`
*   **Changes:**
    *   **Dynamic Auth Mock:** Updated `google-auth-library` mock to simulate different users (User, Artist, Organizer) based on the token suffix.
    *   **Role-Based Tests:** Added specific tests to verify:
        *   Organizer can create events.
        *   User *cannot* create events.
        *   User can join events.
        *   Artist *cannot* join events (Strict Mode check).
        *   Artist can apply to events.
        *   User *cannot* apply to events.
    *   **Updated Existing Flows:** Modified existing tests to use the appropriate role tokens (e.g., using `organizerToken` for creation and deletion, `userToken` for comments).
