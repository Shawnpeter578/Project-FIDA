# Change Log: Remove Artist Login from Frontend

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Author:** Gemini Agent

## Description
Removed the "Artist" login option from the frontend login page (`dist/login.html`). This involves removing the UI button, updating the CSS for the remaining role selectors, and removing the corresponding JavaScript logic for role handling, signup, login verification, and redirection.

## Affected Files
- `dist/login.html`

## Details
1.  **HTML**: Removed the `<button>` for the Artist role.
2.  **CSS**: Updated `.role-highlighter` width from `33.33%` (3 items) to `50%` (2 items).
3.  **JS**:
    -   `setRole()`: Removed 'artist' case and updated highlighter transform logic.
    -   `handleSignup()`: Removed logic that mapped 'artist' role to backend.
    -   `handleLogin()`: Removed logic that checked for 'artist' backend role.
    -   `redirectUser()`: Removed redirection to `artist-dashboard.html`.

## Verification
-   The login page should now only show "Fan" and "Organizer" options.
-   Selecting "Fan" or "Organizer" should correctly update the UI and highlighter.
-   Login and Signup should work for Fan and Organizer roles.
-   Artist login attempts or logic paths are no longer accessible via the UI.
