## Change Log - 2026-02-07 10:30

### Added
- `src/utils/email.js`: New utility to handle sending emails via Nodemailer (configured for Brevo) and generating QR codes.
    - Exports `sendTicketEmail(toEmail, event, ticketData)`.

### Modified
- `src/auth/middleware.js`: Updated `authenticateJWT` to attach `req.userEmail` from the database user record to the request object.
- `src/event_path.js`: 
    - Imported `sendTicketEmail`.
    - Updated `POST /verify-payment`: Calls `sendTicketEmail` after successful payment and DB update.
    - Updated `POST /join`: Calls `sendTicketEmail` after successful free event join.

### Description
Implemented a ticket confirmation system. When a user successfully pays for or joins an event, they now receive an email containing event details and a QR code for check-in. The QR code contains a JSON payload with the event ID, user ID, and ticket ID. This relies on `BREVO_USER` and `BREVO_PASS` environment variables being set.
